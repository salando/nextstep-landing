# NextStep

NextStep is a robotic exoskeleton designed to assist with walking and running. By applying a supportive force to the wearer's legs during movement, it effectively reduces the physical energy required to move.

This project, created for a Grade 12 Capstone, demonstrates the intersection of mechanical engineering, electronics, and software. It documents the complete journey of building a functional wearable robot from the ground up.

### Status: Work in Progress
Please note that this project is currently under active development. Both the physical hardware and this documentation site are updated frequently as testing continues and improvements are made.

## Visit the Website

The project website serves as the primary portfolio for the work. It provides a detailed, accessible explanation of how the exoskeleton functions and the engineering challenges overcome during its creation.
